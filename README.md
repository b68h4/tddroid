## Usage

- Enter the tdbuild/td/tddroid/libtdjsonandroid Folder
  - Run export.sh And Build All Architecture
  
  <s>- Run **ANDROID_SDK_ROOT=../../../ndk-bundle ABI="the platform you want to use" SSL_ABI="ABI's equivalent to SSL_ABI" ./build.sh** </s>
  
  - **If You Don't Run the export.sh File Build.sh or Build-All.sh by itself won't work**
  - **ABI's equivalent to SSL_ABI Available Here --> [Readme 2](https://github.com/bsglinux16/tddroid/blob/master/tdbuild/td/tddroid/libtdjsonandroid/README.md)**
  
- When the build is finished go to the build- "platform-ABI" folder
  - Include the libtdjsonandroid.so File in Your .NET Project

- Open tdsharp/Tdlib.sln Visual Studio and Build the Project
  - Uninstall the TDLib Package You Downloaded From Nuget and Import the TDLib.dll-TDLib.Api.Dll Files You Just Compiled

- Write Telegram App and build .NET Project

- Finally, put the file libtdjsonandroid.so suitable for the platform on which the application will run into the Debug folder.

### Oh my God It is working on Android and other Arm Platforms! ðŸ˜³ðŸ™‚
### Tested on Xamarin x86 and armeabi-v7a Platforms - Successfuly Working!

#### If You Have a Problem, Be Sure to Report to Issue Section
#### Note: I Recommend Compiling On The Server Because It Uses High Processor Power While Compiling.
