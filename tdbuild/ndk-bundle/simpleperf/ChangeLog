ndk r19
Fix report-sample command on Windows.

ndk r18
Improve support of profiling JITed/interpreted Java code on Android >= P:
  1) Support JITed/interpreted Java code in system wide recording.
  2) Support dex files extracted to memory.
  3) Fix some bugs and improve inefficient code.
Improve record command:
  1) Add a user space buffer and a high priority record reading thread to reduce sampe lost rate.
  2) Record full process name instead of only the last 16 bytes.
Improve report_html.py:
  1) Generate flamegraphs in Javascript code instead of using inferno, thus
	   reducing the time used to generate and load report.
  2) Use bootstrap 4 to format UI.
  3) Use progressbar to show progress of loading contents.
  4) Add --binary_filter option to only annotate selected binaries.
